# Neural Correlates of Verbal Suggestibility and Hypnosis
Hypnosis, characterized by a state of heightened attention and increased suggestibility, holds potential as a therapeutic tool. It has been known to yield effects analogous to medication, yet without the associated side effects. Despite widespread interest and extensive research, the understanding of the neural mechanisms behind hypnosis remain elusive. This project undertakes a systematic exploration to uncover the electrophysiological correlates of hypnosis.
